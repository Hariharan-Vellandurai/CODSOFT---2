# ATM Interface in Java (NetBeans IDE 20)
# Overview
This is a simple Java program implementing an ATM interface using NetBeans IDE 20. The program consists of two classes: BankAccount and ATM. The BankAccount class represents a user's bank account, storing the account balance and providing methods for deposit and withdrawal. The ATM class represents the ATM machine, providing a console-based interface for users to withdraw, deposit, and check their balance.

# Features
* **Withdrawal:** Users can withdraw funds from their account, and the program ensures that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the available balance.

* **Deposit:** Users can deposit funds into their account, and the program updates the account balance accordingly.

* **Check Balance:** Users can check their account balance at any time.

* **User Interface:** The program utilizes a simple console-based user interface for interaction.
